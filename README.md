# Meat Industry Data Warehouse

## 📄 Description

This project is a data warehouse solution for a fictional meat distribution company. The main objective is to analyze sales data from an ERP database to gain business intelligence insights. A data cube was developed to explore the information from different perspectives and to facilitate decision-making.

The project was developed as a solution to a company's request to better understand its sales performance, identify trends, and analyze key metrics such as sales by product, customer, location, and time.

## ✨ Key Features

*   **Data Extraction and Transformation:** The project includes the necessary scripts for the creation and loading of data into a Microsoft SQL Server database.
*   **Data Cube:** A data cube was designed and implemented to allow for multidimensional analysis of the sales data.
*   **Reporting and Visualization:** The results of the analysis are presented in reports and visualizations that are easy to understand.
*   **Technology Integration:** The project demonstrates the integration of Microsoft SQL Server with R for data analysis and reporting.
